### [What is Computer Science?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science)

In the words of my first CS professor:
> Computers are very stupid

The very first bit of code I learned was 
```
int main()
{
    cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**I have learned these _programing languages_:**
- [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
- [java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
- [Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language)
- [python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
